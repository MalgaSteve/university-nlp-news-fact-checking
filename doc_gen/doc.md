#### Introduction

The `MultipleAgents` class is designed to manage multiple AI agents concurrently. It utilizes the CrewAI library for agent creation and management.


#### MultipleAgents Class


##### Initialization

The `__init__` method initializes a list of agents with distinct configurations, including different model sizes and memory settings.


```python
self.agents = [
    Agent(name="Agent1", model=LLaMAModel(8), memory=Memory(max_size=1000, update_every=10)),
    Agent(name="Agent2", model=LLaMAModel(16), memory=Memory(max_size=500, update_every=5)),
    Agent(name="Agent3", model=LLaMAModel(32), memory=Memory(max_size=2000, update_every=20))
]
```


##### Run Scenario Method

The `run_scenario` method resets each agent and runs their episodes concurrently using threading.


```python
threads = [threading.Thread(target=agent.run_episodes, args=(10,)) for agent in self.agents]
for thread in threads:
    thread.start()
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
```

I will now provide the final answer.
